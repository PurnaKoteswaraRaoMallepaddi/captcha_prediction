# captcha_prediction
predicting the captcha using convelutional neural networks and open cv,you can down load the data from the https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/ who geunerate the data of captcha if you are such intrested and find it hard to download you can contact me .
I have used the CNN and open CV.
and tensor.npy file is missing so you have to generate it on your own just by running the code.
it took me 3 whole days to complete this wonderfull project thanks for visiting
you can look at the output and enjoy

##Requirements : 
1. Anaconda - This installs python along with most popular python libraries including sklearn. If not already installed, install it from https://www.continuum.io/downloads . 
2. keras - Python library for Deep Learning.
3. opencv - Python library for playing with the images.

##Preparing Data Set:
1. Run the code `my_capcha_modified.py` then the new directory will be created which stores the images of the single piece of the  digits.
2. Then the Convelutional model will be trained and the model will be stoed in the format of `.hf5` .
3. Before that the `.npy` file formats will also be stored for the furthur use.
4. When the new Data poece is given it make it into the parts and then it will predict the unit format and then predict iin whole.

##Output :
- As shown in  the image , whenn ever you give the input directory in the file then the out put image will ge shown to yo
u
- Its application will be used in web scraping the captcha saved websites.
